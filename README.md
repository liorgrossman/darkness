**Darkness** is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that provides **dark themes** for many popular websites, such as Google, Facebook, Gmail and YouTube.

Using dark themes reduces the eye strain and fatigue caused by a bright screen, helps you sleep faster and better at night, and generally makes you awesome!
